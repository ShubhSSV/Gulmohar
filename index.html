                <br>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Gulmohar plant is known for its ornamental beauty and environmental benefits. It provides substantial shade and reduces the temperature in its surroundings, making it ideal for hot climates. Its vibrant flowers support biodiversity by attracting bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. In traditional medicine, various parts of the plant, especially the bark and seeds, are used to treat ailments like inflammation, arthritis, and pain due to their anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, the plant helps to purify the air by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen, contributing to improved air quality.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Gulmohar trees bloom during the summer, generally from late spring to early monsoon. In regions with a pronounced dry season, they produce vibrant, flame-colored flowers that cover the entire tree, creating a striking visual display. The blooming period usually lasts several weeks, with peak flowering occurring in the hottest months. After flowering, the tree develops long, dark seed pods that hang down, which persist through the rest of the year. The plant thrives in areas with ample sunlight and moderate rainfall.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to Madagascar, the Gulmohar has been naturalized in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, especially in countries like India, the Caribbean, South Africa, and Australia. It thrives in regions with a warm climate and well-drained soils, where it can grow as a street, garden, or roadside tree. In India, it is particularly common in states with warmer climates, such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, where it has become a popular landscape plant in both rural and urban areas due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Lifespan: Gulmohar trees have a relatively long lifespan, often reaching 30 to 50 years with proper care. These fast-growing trees can reach full maturity within 10 years, growing as tall as 10-12 meters. They require minimal maintenance once established but can benefit from occasional pruning to maintain their shape and health. Though primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, a well-cared-for Gulmohar can continue to thrive for decades, adding shade, beauty, and ecological value to its surroundings.</p>
